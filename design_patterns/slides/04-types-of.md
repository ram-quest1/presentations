# Types of Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
These patterns manage object creation, offering flexibility and control over instantiation. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype. Even IoC or Dependency Injection also falls under this loosely. 

### Structural Patterns
These patterns focus on composing classes and objects into larger structures. Some 
examples are Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Composite, and Facade. 

### Behavioral Patterns
These patterns define communication and interaction between objects. Key examples include Observer, Strategy, Command, Iterator, and Chain of Responsibility.
